# Portuguese-Bank-Marketing-Analysis

In the context of a Portuguese Banking institution’s direct marketing campaign for term deposits, we address the challenges of predicting the client subscriptions. We navigate through imbalances, feature complexities and outliers to optimize predictive accuracy, providing insights into the effectiveness of marketing strategies. Our robust workflow aims to enhance subscription rates ad empower data driven decision making for the future campaigns.

The dataset, we have used for this project is from the UCI repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing. In this dataset, we have ~41000 instances and 21 features which are categorical and numerical in nature. The target variable which is the subscription term deposit is ‘Y’ which is identified by whether a client has subscribed to a particular term deposit or not. 

We have followed a systemic approach from preprocessing the data to facilitate training and making predictions. We implemented an end-to-end workflow starting with data preprocessing to model implementation and evaluation.
